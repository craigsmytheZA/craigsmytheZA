- 👋 Welcome to my Git, I’m Craig Smythe, Head Software Wizard at CL3 Industries.
- 👀 I'm currently focused on the Contact Center Compliancy and Analytics space and on connecting the unconnected through IOT and Kiosk technologies.
- 🌱 I am a strong and versatile developer who is used to working on very agile projects with different codesets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on facial recognition applications and speech analytics solutions that have high accuracy rates.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be a radio star... oompf,oompf,oompf...
